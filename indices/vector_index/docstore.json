If there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer will endeavor to low census \nagency nurses first, then per diem nurses, then nurses working an extra shift on a non-premium \nbasis and then will endeavor to rotate low census equitably among all nurses working their \nregular scheduled shift. Selection for low census is subject to skill, competence, ability and \navailability as determined by the Employer. A traveling nurse who is employed on a contract \nbasis for a defined period of weeks shall participate in the rotation of low census with other full-\ntime and part-time employees. A list of the number of low census hours (including voluntary low \ncensus days) for each nurse will be maintained and be available. The rotation list will be \nrestarted each six (6) months.

EVERGREENHEALTH 
and the 
WASHINGTON STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION 
This Agreement is made and entered into by and between EvergreenHealth (hereinafter referred to as 
the “Employer” or the “Hospital”) and the Washington State Nurses Association (hereinafter referred 
to as the “Association”). The purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the understanding reached 
between the parties with respect to wages, hours of work and conditions of employment. 
PREAMBLE 
The Employer and the Association share the common goal of providing quality healthcare services to 
the community by creating an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual respect which supports the 
practice and growth of professional nursing. 
ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION 
1.1 
Bargaining Unit. The Employer recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive 
bargaining representative for all regularly scheduled full-time, regularly scheduled part-time and per 
diem registered nurses engaged in patient care at the Hospital, excluding supervisors, nursing care 
coordinators, temporary nurses, students, and all other employees. New classifications of registered 
nurses engaged in patient care established during the life of this Agreement shall be covered by this 
Agreement. 
ARTICLE 2 - ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP AND DUES 
2.1 
Membership — Current Employee. The Hospital will provide information in response to 
bargaining unit nurses’ inquiries but agrees to remain neutral with respect to nurses’ decision about 
union membership and payroll deduction.  The Hospital agrees to direct all communications from 
employees regarding the WSNA payroll deductions to the Association or to this Agreement. 
2.2 
Dues Deduction.   The Hospital will honor a nurse’s authorization in accordance with its 
terms after receiving notice of the authorization terms in writing from WSNA.  The amounts 
deducted shall be transmitted monthly to the Association on behalf of the nurses involved, and upon 
transmittal, the Hospital’s responsibility shall cease with respect to such deductions. The Association 
hereby undertakes to indemnify and hold the Hospital harmless from all claims, demands, suits or 
other forms of liability which shall arise against the Hospital for or on account of any such deduction 
made from the wages of a nurse pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.   A nurse’s request to 
revoke authorization for payroll deductions must be in writing and submitted by the nurse to the 
exclusive bargaining representative in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
authorization with a copy to the Employer.

2.3 
Bargaining Unit Roster. Twice a year (in the months of January and July), the 
Employer shall provide the Association and the Local Unit Chairperson with a list, via 
spreadsheet attachment to e-mail, of those nurses covered by this Agreement. This list will 
contain each employee’s name, employee identification number, address, telephone number, 
FTE, shift (day, evening or night), length of shift (8-hour, 9-hour, 10-hour or 12-hour), rate of 
pay, nursing department and date of hire. Each month, the Employer shall provide the 
Association and the Local Unit Chairperson with a list, via spreadsheet attachment to e-mail, of 
all employees covered by this Agreement hired during the previous month and all employees 
moved into positions covered by this Agreement during the previous month. This list shall 
contain each employee’s name, employee identification number, address, telephone number, 
FTE, shift (day, evening or night), length of shift (8-hour, 9-hour, 10-hour or 12-hour), rate of

left the bargaining unit, resigned or were terminated during the previous month. 
2.4 
Contract. The Employer will make this Agreement available to each nurse covered by 
this Agreement and to all newly hired nurses by posting a copy on the Employer’s electronic 
bulletin board. During nursing orientation, the Employer shall allow the Local Unit Chairperson 
or designee thirty minutes to meet with newly hired nurses, who shall be paid at their regular 
rates of pay. 
2.5 
Bulletin Boards. The Association shall be permitted to post Association 
notices/newsletters on bulletin board space designated by the Employer on each unit. All 
postings will be signed and dated by a Local Unit Officer. Additionally, the Employer shall post 
the minutes of the Conference Committee and the Patient Care Committee on the Employer’s 
electronic bulletin board. 
2.6 
Local Unit Chairperson (LUC). The Association shall have the right to select a local 
unit chairperson(s) from among nurses in the unit. The Association shall promptly notify the 
employer in writing of any changes of Local Unit officers. The local unit chairperson(s) shall not 
be recognized by the Employer until the Association has given the Employer written notice of 
the selection. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Employer, the investigation of grievances by the 
LUC or designee and other Association business shall be conducted only during nonworking 
times, and shall not interfere with the work of other employees. 
2.7 
Access to Premises. Duly authorized representatives of the Association may have access 
at reasonable times to those areas of the Employer’s premises which are open to the general 
public for the purpose of investigating grievances and contract compliance. Association 
representatives shall not have access to nurses’ lounges, nursing units or other patient care areas 
unless prior approval has been obtained from the Director of Employee and Labor Relations or 
designee. Access to the Employer’s premises shall be subject to the same general rules 
applicable to other non-employees, and shall not interfere with or disturb nurses in the 
performance of their work during working hours and shall not interfere with patient care or the 
normal operation of the Hospital, and shall be limited to areas which do not violate hospital 
security and/or confidential Hospital files. 
2.8 
Negotiations. The Employer will make all reasonable efforts to ensure local unit 
representatives will be given time off for Interest-Based Negotiations (IBN). The Association 
 
3 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
will make all reasonable efforts to provide the Employer with the names of the local unit 
representatives who will be on the Association’s negotiating team at least six (6) weeks in 
advance of negotiations or any related training. 
2.9 
Public Information Requests. The Hospital will notify the Association of any public 
records request that seeks personal information related to the bargaining unit as a whole. Notice 
will be provided as soon as practicable following receipt. The Hospital will make a good faith 
effort to provide notice prior to transmission of any documents in response to public records 
requests. 
ARTICLE 3 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS 
3.1 
Management Rights. The Association recognizes that the Employer has the obligation 
of serving the public with the highest quality of patient care, efficiently and economically, and 
meeting medical emergencies. Therefore, subject to the express terms and conditions of this 
Agreement, the management of the hospital and the direction of the work force, including the 
right to hire, classify, orient, train, assign, transfer, float, promote, maintain discipline, order and 
efficiency of its employees; to discipline, demote or discharge full-time and part-time nurses for 
just cause, provided, however, the Employer reserves the right to discharge any nurse deemed to

faith; and the right to relieve employees from duty due to lack of work, low census conditions or 
for other reasons; the right to require reasonable overtime work of employees consistent with the 
provisions of Section 7.5, Overtime; the right to promulgate, revise and modify rules, regulations

3.2 
The Association recognizes that the above statement of management rights is for 
illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as restrictive or interpreted so as to 
exclude those prerogatives not mentioned which are inherent to the management function. All

same FTE and shift) based on available openings.   
ARTICLE 5 - EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES  
5.1 
Equal Opportunity. The Employer and the Association agree that conditions of employment 
shall be consistent with applicable state and federal laws regarding nondiscrimination. If a charge 
based on an alleged violation of this section is filed with a federal, state or local agency, the charge 
shall be handled exclusively through that agency and not through the grievance procedure of this 
Agreement. 
5.2 
Personnel File. Nurses shall have access to the information in their personnel file. Nurses 
shall receive all Personnel Action Request forms which specify conditions of hiring, rate of pay, 
status, shift or leaves of absence. 
5.3 
Posting. The Employer will provide an in-house transfer request system and related 
procedures. Nurses who wish to transfer from their current position, unit or shift may submit an 
Internal Transfer Request Application. The Employer will post a notice of all Registered Nurse job 
openings on a designated bulletin board on the particular unit, in the Hospital and on the web site 
at least seven (7) calendar days in advance of filling the position. Full-time and part-time nurses 
currently employed on the particular unit shall be given first consideration. If a full-time or part-
time nurse(s) on the unit where the vacancy occurs applies for the open position, either through 
 
6 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
an application filed in response to the posting or by an on-file Internal Transfer Request 
Application, the position will be awarded within three weekdays (Monday — Friday) following 
the completion of the seven (7) day posting period, provided there is a qualified part-time or full-
time in-unit applicant and all part-time or full-time in-unit applications have been considered. 
Providing skill, competence, ability and prior documented job performance of in-unit applicants 
are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer, seniority will be the 
determining factor in filling vacant positions. The vacant position may only be awarded to a 
qualified full-time or part-time in-unit applicant at the conclusion of the seven (7) day posting 
period. 
If there is no qualified full-time or part-time in-unit applicant, the posting shall continue 
for a minimum of three (3) additional days [i.e., a minimum of ten (10) days from the date of the 
initial posting]. 
Providing skill, competence, ability and prior documented job performance are 
considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer, seniority will be the determining 
factor in filling vacant positions as follows: 
a. 
Full-time or part-time nurses currently employed on the particular unit shall be 
given first consideration. 
b. 
Full-time or part-time nurses employed within the Hospital shall be given second 
consideration. 
5.4 
Orientation. Orientation will consist of a basic comprehensive program in which the 
nurse will be oriented through a combination of instructional conferences, floor and/or shift 
work. The objectives of orientation shall be to familiarize new personnel with the objectives and 
philosophy of the Hospital and nursing service, to orient new personnel to hospital policies and 
procedures, and to instruct new nurses as to their functions and responsibilities as defined in job 
descriptions. Nurses shall not be required to perform tasks or procedures for which they have not 
been trained so that they may perform the tasks or procedures safely and independently.  The 
Hospital will provide cross-training to nurses who request it with mutual agreement between the 
nurse and the affected managers. 
5.5 
Discipline or Discharge. Discipline or discharge of a full-time or part-time nurse shall 
only be for just cause. “Just cause” shall include the concept of progressive discipline (such as 
verbal and written reprimands and the possibility of suspension without pay), provided, however, 
a nurse may be subject to immediate dismissal or suspension based upon the seriousness of the 
offense. A nurse may request the attendance of an Association representative at scheduled 
investigatory meetings as provided for and limited by law. A copy of all written disciplinary 
actions shall be given to the nurse. Nurses shall be required to sign the written disciplinary action 
for the purpose of acknowledging receipt thereof. Nurses will be given the opportunity to 
provide a written response to any written evaluations or disciplinary actions to be included in the 
personnel file. 
5.6 
Notice of Resignation. Nurses are strongly encouraged to give at least four (4) weeks’ 
notice of resignation to their appropriate supervisor, but in no event shall a nurse give less than 
 
7 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
twenty-one (21) days’ written notice of resignation. The twenty-one (21) day notice requirement 
shall not include any vacation time or unverified sick leave unless approved by supervision. 
Failure to give notice shall result in loss of accrued vacation benefits. 
5.7 
Performance Appraisal. A written appraisal of performance shall be conducted at the end 
of the probationary period and annually thereafter, which shall be made available to the nurse 
and which shall be able to be printed by the nurse. 
5.8 
Change of Employee Classification. Hospital employees who secure RN licensure and 
continue employment at the Hospital in a registered nurse position shall not lose previously 
accrued vacation or sick leave. All hours previously accrued for vacation purposes shall be 
credited for placement on the vacation schedule. 
5.9 
Re-Employment. Nurses rehired within twenty-four (24) months of voluntary 
termination shall be re-employed at their prior step on the wage scale, or at the step 
commensurate with their experience pursuant to Section 8.3, whichever is greater. 
ARTICLE 6 - SENIORITY. LAYOFF AND RECALL 
6.1 
Seniority Defined. Full-time and part-time nurses shall accrue seniority as provided for 
in this Article. Per diem nurses shall not accrue seniority. Seniority shall mean a nurse’s length 
of service as a registered nurse based on credited hours (Section 4.8) in the bargaining unit 
beginning from most recent date of hire as a regular employee. Seniority shall not apply to a 
nurse until completion of the required probationary period. Upon satisfactory completion of this 
probationary period, the nurse shall be credited with seniority from most recent date of hire. 
Regular nurses who change to per diem status and subsequently return to regular status without a 
break in employment shall retain previously accrued seniority, including any per diem hours 
worked during the intervening time, which will be restored on the effective date of transfer into 
regular status. Non-bargaining unit nurses shall not use their seniority for job bidding purposes 
or to displace (bump) a bargaining unit nurse during a layoff. Only after obtaining a bargaining 
unit position will prior seniority apply. Effective March 14, 2013, nurses who leave employment 
with the Employer and return to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year shall have their 
previous seniority restored once back in a bargaining unit position. Only after obtaining a 
bargaining unit position and completion of the required probationary period will seniority apply. 
6.1.1 Seniority for layoff purposes shall be measured as of the end of the first full pay 
period ending immediately prior to the date upon which Notice of Layoff is sent to the 
Association. 
6.2 
Layoff. A layoff is defined as any mandatory, permanent or prolonged reduction in the 
number of full-time or part-time nurses employed by the Medical Center. A layoff may also 
occur if there is a mandatory reduction in scheduled hours or change of shift. Where skill, 
competence, ability and experience are substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer, 
seniority shall be the determining factor when utilizing this layoff procedure. The Employer will 
give the Association, the local unit chairperson and the affected full-time and part-time nurses at 
least thirty (30) calendar days’ advance written notice of a layoff or pay in lieu thereof, based on 
scheduled hours missed. As soon as practical thereafter, the Employer will provide the 
 
8 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
Association with a roster listing all bargaining unit nurses, their seniority, unit, shift and hours 
worked per pay period. Upon request, the parties will meet for the purpose of reviewing the 
procedure to be utilized and the order of layoff. If the Employer determines a layoff to be 
necessary, the following procedures shall be followed: 
6.2.1 The Employer shall identify the unit(s), shift(s) and number of FTEs which will be 
subject to layoff. The position(s) of the least senior nurse(s) on the unit and shift to be 
eliminated to accomplish the required FTE reduction on that unit and shift will be 
identified. Those nurses whose positions have been eliminated shall be considered 
“displaced nurses”. The Local Unit Chairperson or designee, if available, shall be present 
when displaced nurses are given their bumping options. The Local Unit Chairperson or 
designee’s time off shall not be paid. 
6.2.2 Displaced nurses, by seniority, shall have the following options: 
a. 
A displaced nurse wishing to remain on his/her unit may bump into the position of 
either the least senior full-time or the least senior part-time nurse on the nurse’s 
unit; or 
b. 
Low Seniority Roster. The Employer shall provide a Low Seniority Roster made 
up of the positions held by the least senior nurses in the Medical Center, including 
any vacant positions, equal to the number of positions to be eliminated plus ten 
(10) positions. By seniority, a displaced nurse may choose a position on the Low 
Seniority Roster. 
If there is no position with an equivalent FTE for which the nurse is qualified to select, the nurse 
may select a vacant position. If no vacant position is available, the nurse may select the position 
of the least senior nurse in the bargaining unit (regardless of FTE) providing the nurse is 
qualified. 
Any nurse bumped out of his/her position as a result of this procedure may bump the position of 
the least senior nurse in the bargaining unit providing the nurse is qualified. A nurse will be 
considered eligible to select the position of a less senior nurse pursuant to this procedure or a 
vacant position if, in the Employer’s opinion, the nurse could become oriented to the position 
and thereafter function independently at acceptable performance levels within three (3) weeks. If 
a nurse has not achieved a satisfactory level of performance in the opinion of the Employer after 
completing the three (3) weeks of orientation to the new position, the nurse will be subject to 
layoff and placement on the recall roster. 
Note: For purposes of this layoff procedure, a “full-time” position is a position with 70 or more 
scheduled hours per pay period. A “part-time” position is a position with less than 70 scheduled 
hours per pay period. 
c. 
Any nurse may choose to be laid off rather than select an alternative position 
provided for in (a) or (b) above, without affecting the nurse’s recall rights. 
d. 
Nurses on layoff will be allowed to transfer to per diem status without loss of 
recall rights. 
 
9 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
6.3 
Restructure of Staff. Restructure of staff may occur when two (2) or more units merge or 
consolidate, or when the FTE complement on a unit is reconfigured or changed, or a change in 
shift patterns occurs (e.g. 12-hour staffing to 8 or 10-hour staffing, or vice versa). The Employer 
will give the Association, the Local Unit Chairperson and the affected full-time and part-time 
nurses at least thirty (30) calendar days’ written notice in advance of the restructure 
implementation date. Upon request, the parties will meet for the purpose of reviewing the 
procedure to be utilized to accomplish the restructure. A local unit chairperson, or designee, shall 
be present when, in accordance with the following procedures, new position assignments are 
made by the Hospital. The specific method by which nurses are provided with their options may 
vary depending on the circumstances. In the event the Employer determines that a reallocation of 
staff is necessary, the following procedure will be followed: 
6.3.1 The Employer will eliminate all existing positions on the unit(s) to be restructured. 
6.3.2 The Employer will determine and post the number of full-time and part-time FTEs 
by shift required for the new or restructured unit. The posted positions shall be identified 
by unit, shift and hours per pay period. At this time, the Employer shall also determine 
any specific skill or qualification requirements needed on each shift. 
Low Seniority Roster. If the restructured unit results in fewer positions after the 
restructure than existed prior to the restructure, the Employer shall provide a Low 
Seniority Roster made up of the positions held by the least senior nurses in the Medical 
Center, including any vacant positions, sufficient to bring the number of available 
positions after the restructure up to the number of positions on the restructured unit(s) 
prior to the restructure. (e.g. If a unit has thirty (30) positions prior to a restructure and 
twenty-five (25) after the restructure, the Medical Center would identify the five (5) least 
senior nurses’ positions in the bargaining unit.) 
6.3.3 By seniority, nurses may choose from the positions available on the restructured 
unit(s) or from a position on the Low Seniority Roster for which the nurse is qualified. 
Nurses bumped off the Low Seniority Roster may bump into the position of the least 
senior nurse in the bargaining unit for which the nurse is qualified. Nurses who are not 
able to bump shall be considered on layoff. 
6.4 
Recall. Nurses on layoff status shall be placed on a reinstatement roster for a period of 
twelve (12) months from the date of layoff. When vacancies occur, the order of reinstatement 
shall, subject to Section 5.3, be by seniority (most senior first), providing the nurse’s skills, 
competence, ability and experience are substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. There 
shall be no loss of benefits or previously accrued seniority if the nurse is recalled within twelve (12) 
months. 
6.4.1 Notification of Recall. If a nurse does not respond to a recall notice sent by certified 
mail or receipted telegram within seven (7) calendar days of receipt, the nurse will be 
removed from the recall roster and the personnel records shall be adjusted to reflect the 
nurse’s termination. The nurse shall notify the Employer by certified mail of any change in 
the nurse’s current mailing address. If the nurse fails to provide this notification, the nurse’s 
name shall be eliminated from the recall list and the Employer’s recall commitments shall 
 
10 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
terminate. If a nurse must give two (2) weeks’ notice at another facility, the nurse will be 
allowed two (2) weeks to report back to work. 
6.5 
Termination of Seniority/Recall Rights. Seniority and recall rights shall terminate upon 
cessation of the employment relationship; for example, discharge, resignation, retirement, acceptance 
of severance pay, refusal to accept a comparable job opening (same FTE and shift) offered by the 
Employer while on layoff, after twelve (12) consecutive months of layoff, or failure to comply with 
specified recall procedures. 
6.6 
Expedited Dispute Resolution. Disputes involving this process (Article 6) shall initially be 
heard at Step 2 of the grievance procedure. If the matter cannot be resolved at Step 2, the parties 
mutually agree to make a good faith effort to expedite the grievance process including arbitration of 
the issue. 
6.7 
Severance Pay. The Employer will provide full-time and part-time nurses with the same 
severance pay policy as is provided to other Hospital employees. Nurses who accept severance pay 
are not eligible for layoff and recall. 
ARTICLE 7 - HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME 
7.1 
Work Day. The normal work day shall consist of eight (8), nine (9), ten (10), or twelve (12) 
hours of work, excluding meal periods. 
7.2 
Work Period. The normal work period shall consist of forty (40) hours of work within a 
seven (7) day period or eighty (80) hours of work within a fourteen (14) day period. 
7.2.1 7 Day Staffing. The normal work period shall consist of a seven (7) consecutive day 
period of work followed by seven (7) consecutive days off duty. 
7.2.2 12-Hour Staffing. The normal, full-time, work period shall consist of three (3) twelve 
(12) hour shifts per seven (7) day period. 
7.2.3 Innovative Work Schedules. An innovative schedule is defined as a work schedule that 
requires a change, modification or waiver of any provisions of this Employment Agreement. 
Written innovative work schedules may be established by mutual agreement between the 
Hospital and the nurse involved. Prior to the implementation of a new innovative work 
schedule, the Employer and the Association will review and determine conditions of 
employment relating to that work schedule. Where innovative schedules are utilized, the 
Employer retains the right to revert back to the work schedule which was in effect 
immediately prior to the innovative work schedule, after at least thirty (30) days’ advance 
notice to the nurse. 
7.3 
Work Schedules. Monthly work schedules shall be posted at least ten (10) days prior to 
the beginning of the scheduled work period. Nurses desiring additional hours shall notify their 
nurse manager or designee in writing. 
7.3.1 7 Day Staffing. Nurses working the 7 Day Staffing schedule shall be scheduled in 
accordance with the annual changeover calendar. 
 
11 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
7.4 
Change in Schedule. It is recognized and understood that deviations from the normal 
hours of work will occur from time to time, resulting from several causes, such as but not limited 
to vacations, leave of absence, absenteeism, employee requests, temporary shortage of personnel. low 
census and emergencies. The Employer retains the right to adjust work schedules to maintain an 
efficient and orderly operation. Except for emergency conditions involving patient care and low 
census conditions, individual scheduled hours of work set forth on the posted work schedules 
may be changed only by mutual consent. 
7.4.1 7 Day Staffing. A schedule for the annual changeover of starting days shall be 
maintained. 
7.5 
Overtime. All overtime must be approved by the appropriate supervisor. Overtime shall be 
paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay for all time worked 
beyond the normal work day (7.1) or normal work period (7.2). Except as provided in 7.5.2, if a 
nurse works more than twelve (12) consecutive hours in a work day, all additional overtime 
hours after twelve (12) consecutive hours shall be paid at the rate of double (2x) the nurse’s 
regular rate of pay. Overtime will be paid to the nearest fifteen (15) minutes, calculated at one 
and one-half (1 1/2) times the nurse’s regular rate of pay which shall include shift differential 
and the benefit option premium. Time paid for but not worked shall not count as time worked for 
the purpose of computing overtime. The Employer and the Union agree that overtime should be 
minimized. The Employer will not require its nurses to work beyond their scheduled shifts or 
work periods if doing so would violate the state law limiting mandatory overtime (RCW 
49.28.130-.150).  
Subject to the Nurse Practice Act, no nurse will be expected to work beyond the end of the 
nurse’s scheduled shift to the extent that the nurse is not able to function with reasonable skill 
and safety with respect to care of the Medical Center’s patients. If the nurse can no longer function 
with reasonable skill and safety, the nurse should immediately discuss the matter with her/his 
immediate supervisor. The supervisor shall take all practical measures to transition the nurse’s 
duties as soon as possible. Work schedules will not be altered for the sole purpose of avoiding 
the payment of overtime. The double time provisions of this section shall not apply to time spent in 
non-mandatory committee meetings, staff meetings, or time spent for educational purposes (i.e. CE 
days, educational leave, educational offerings, etc.).  Any nurse who is required to stay beyond the 
end of shift in order to complete an operating room procedure which was originally scheduled in 
such a manner that it could not be reasonably completed prior to the end of the nurse’s shift, shall be 
paid at one-and three-quarter times (1 and ¾) the nurse’s regular rate of pay.  This would not apply to 
cases delayed by emergency additions, cases that were delayed due to late completion of a previous 
surgery, or procedures where the time needed exceeded the original estimate due to unforeseen 
circumstances.   
7.5.1 7 Day Staffing. If a nurse works seven (7) consecutive days (including low census 
days), the nurse shall receive time and one-half (1 1/2) for all hours worked during the 
nurse’s scheduled week off. 
7.5.2 12-Hour Staffing. Overtime shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) 
for the first two (2) hours after the end of a twelve (12) hour shift or after forty (40) hours 
in a seven (7) day work period as defined by the Hospital. Overtime shall be paid at the 
rate of time and one-half (11/2) for all time worked after thirty-six (36) hours in a seven 
 
12 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
(7) day period, if a full-time twelve (12) hour nurse works in excess of thirty-six (36) 
hours. All time worked beyond fourteen (14) consecutive hours worked shall be paid at 
the rate of double time (2x). 
7.6 
No Pyramiding. There shall be no pyramiding or duplication of overtime pay and/or 
other premium compensation paid at the rate of one and one-half times the regular rate which 
would result in compensation exceeding one and one-half time for the same hours worked. 
7.7 
Meal/Rest Periods. Meal periods and rest periods shall be administered in accordance 
with state law . Nurses shall be allowed an unpaid meal period of one-half (1/2) hour. Nurses are 
strongly encouraged to take meal periods. Nurses required by the Employer to remain on duty 
during their meal period shall be compensated for such time at the appropriate rate of pay. All 
nurses shall be allowed a rest period of fifteen (15) minutes on the Employer’s time, for each 
four (4) hours of working time. The meal periods and/or rest breaks may be combined with 
mutual agreement between the Employer and nurse. The Employer will provide a mechanism for 
recording missed meal periods and rest breaks within a pay period in its time and attendance 
system. Nurses must record and attest to any missed meal periods/rest breaks in the Employer’s 
time and attendance system within the pay period in which the rest break or meal period is 
missed. 
7.8 
Low Census. During periods of low census, the Employer will first select nurses working 
on a regularly scheduled day off and being paid at a rate of time and one half or higher, and then 
ask for volunteers. If there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer will endeavor to low census 
agency nurses first, then per diem nurses, then nurses working an extra shift on a non-premium 
basis and then will endeavor to rotate low census equitably among all nurses working their 
regular scheduled shift. Selection for low census is subject to skill, competence, ability and 
availability as determined by the Employer. A traveling nurse who is employed on a contract 
basis for a defined period of weeks shall participate in the rotation of low census with other full-
time and part-time employees. A list of the number of low census hours (including voluntary low 
census days) for each nurse will be maintained and be available. The rotation list will be 
restarted each six (6) months. Full-time and part-time nurses will not be required to take more 
than 48 hours of mandatory low census from January 1 through June 30 and from July 1 through 
December 31. Nurses taking low census shall receive credited hours as provided in Section 4.8 
on canceled hours of work. At the nurse’s option, a nurse may use vacation pay for low census. 
If a nurse agrees to standby status while on low census, the nurse may request vacation pay for 
that day in addition to standby pay. The Employer will make a pager available at the hospital for 
optional use by the nurse during the nurse’s period of low census standby. Low census guidelines 
and any changes thereto shall not be implemented without prior review and discussion with the 
Conference Committee. 
7.9 
Low Census Standby. Nurses who are subject to low census may be requested to be on 
standby for that low census shift. If called in, the nurse shall be paid in accordance with the 
standby (8.5) and callback (8.6) provisions of the Agreement. 
7.10 Late Start Standby. In the event the Employer decides to begin a nurse’s shift after its 
scheduled start time, such nurse shall be given the option of either being placed on low census for a 
period not to exceed four (4) hours or being placed on late start standby for a period not to exceed 
 
13 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
four (4) hours. The nurse shall not be subject to low census for the remainder of the shift. In the event 
the nurse is called back into work during the late start standby period, he or she will be paid at time 
and one-half (1 1/2) for all time worked during the late start standby period. All hours worked 
outside the late start standby period will be paid at the appropriate rate. 
7.11 
Floating. A full-time or part-time nurse will receive low census credit for floating for 
purposes of the low census rotation set forth in Section 7.8. Nurses who are assigned to the Float 
Pool will be subject to low census, but will not receive low census credit for floating within their two 
(2) clinical groupings. 
7.12 Floating. While the Hospital retains the right to change a nurse’s daily work assignment on a 
shift-by-shift basis in order to best meet patient care needs, a nurse will not be required to perform 
tasks or procedures for which a nurse has not been currently trained. In the event floating is 
necessary, a reasonable effort will be made to float a nurse within the nurse’s specialty area; 
however, a nurse may be floated outside the nurse’s specialty area as a staff helper if the nurse is not 
qualified to take a patient care assignment. Any nurse required to float shall receive adequate 
orientation appropriate for the assignment. A nurse shall inform the Charge Nurse of any task or 
procedure for which the nurse is inadequately trained. In no event shall a nurse be required to float if 
there is a per diem or traveler nurse on her/his unit that is qualified to float to the unit in need. 
7.13 Float Pool Premium. Any full time or part time nurse with regularly scheduled shifts and hours 
designated to the Float Pool, shall receive a five dollar ($5.00) per hour premium for all hours 
worked as a Float Pool nurse, in addition to the nurse’s regular rate. This will be paid for all 
productive and non-productive hours. Nurses who are not part of the Float Pool, but who float to 
another unit for a shift are not eligible for this premium.

compensation occurring during this Agreement shall become effective at the beginning of the first 
full payroll period on or after the date designated for the increase. 
8.3 
Recognition of Past Experience - New Hires. Nurses hired during the life of this 
Agreement shall be given full credit for continuous recent nursing experience when placed on the 
wage scale. For purposes of this section, continuous recent experience shall be defined as clinical 
nursing experience in an accredited facility without a break in nursing experience which would 
reduce the level of nursing skills in the opinion of the Employer. A break in service of twelve (12) 
months or more may disqualify a nurse for advanced standing under this provision. 
8.4 
Shift Differential. Nurses assigned to work the second shift (3-11:30) shall be paid a shift 
differential of two dollars and seventy-five cents ($2.75) per hour over the hourly contract rates of 
pay. Nurses assigned to work the third shift (11 p.m. - 7:30 a.m.) shall be paid a shift differential of 
four dollars and fifty cents ($4.50) per hour over the hourly contract rates of pay. Nurses shall be 
paid shift differential for those hours worked on a second or third shift if four (4) or more hours are 
worked on the designated shift. If a nurse works more than her/his scheduled shift, the nurse who is 
assigned to third shift and works into first shift will maintain the nurse’s shift differential for all 
hours worked on the first shift. 
8.5 
Standby. Nurses placed on standby status off hospital premises shall be compensated at the 
rate of four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25) per hour for fifty (50) hours or less per pay period 
and six dollars ($6.00) per hour for all hours over fifty (50) hours in a pay period.  Standby duty shall 
not be counted as hours worked for purposes of computing overtime or eligibility for longevity steps 
or benefits. Nurses on standby shall be provided with signal devices upon request. A standby 
assignment does not begin until completion of the nurse’s regularly scheduled shift and any overtime 
hours worked in conjunction with the nurse’s regular shift and the nurse has clocked out. 
8.6 
Callback Pay. If a nurse is called in to work while on standby status, the nurse shall be paid 
for all hours worked at one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay with a minimum 
guarantee of three (3) hours. A nurse shall not be required to stay the full three (3) hours if advised 
by the Nurse Manager that no work is available. The Employer will attempt to avoid calling in nurses 
who are not on standby status. 
8.7 
Charge Nurse Premium. A nurse shall be paid a premium of two dollars and seventy-five 
cents ($2.75) per hour for all hours assigned as Charge Nurse. 
8.8 
Preceptor Premium. A nurse shall be paid a premium of one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) 
per hour for all hours assigned as a Preceptor. 
 
15

8.9 
Certification Premium. Nurses certified in a specialty area by a national organization and 
working in that area of certification shall be paid a premium of one dollar and twenty-five cents 
($1.25) per hour, provided that the nurse continues to meet all educational and other requirements to 
keep the certification current and in good standing. 
8.9.1 A list of approved certification programs will be kept in Human Resources and on the 
intranet. Once per year, the list will be reviewed by the Conference Committee. New 
certification programs may be considered for addition to the list by submitting a thorough 
program description, including purpose, scope, term, prerequisites for certification, 
recertification fee schedule, mailing address, and any other pertinent information to the 
Conference Committee. 
8.9.2 The Chief Nursing Officer shall have the final decision as to whether any changes will 
be made to the list. 
8.9.3 The nurse must document certification achievement and recertification with Human 
Resources. 
8.9.4 A certified nurse is eligible for only one nursing certification premium, regardless of 
other certifications a nurse may have. 
8.10  
Degree Premium. Nurses with a BSN degree or BA in nursing shall be paid a premium of one 
dollar ($1.00) per hour and nurses with a MSN degree or MA in nursing shall be paid an additional 
premium of one dollar ($1.00) per hour for a total of $2.00 per hour. 
8.11  
Work in Advance of Shift. When a nurse reports for work in advance of the assigned shift 
and continues working during the scheduled shift, all hours worked prior to the scheduled shift shall 
be paid at time and one-half (1 1/2) the straight time rate of pay. A nurse who reports to work in 
advance of the assigned shift will not be released from duty prior to the completion of that scheduled 
shift for the purpose of avoiding overtime pay unless there is mutual consent. 
8.12  
Report Pay. Nurses who report for work as scheduled (unless otherwise notified in advance) 
and are released from duty by the Employer because of low census shall receive a minimum of four 
(4) hours’ work at the regular rate of pay. This commitment shall not apply when the Employer 
has made a good faith effort to notify the nurse at least one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in advance 
of the scheduled shift. It shall be the responsibility of the nurse to notify the Hospital of the 
employee’s current address and telephone number. 
8.13  Weekend Premium Pay. Any nurse who works on a regularly scheduled weekend shall 
receive four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25) per hour for each hour worked on the weekend 
in addition to the nurse’s regular rate of pay. Weekend premium pay shall not be included in the 
nurse’s regular rate of pay for overtime pay calculations, unless required by the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. The weekend shall be defined as all hours between 11:00 p.m. Friday and 7:30 
a.m. Monday. For a nurse starting a shift at 11:00 p.m. on Sunday or later, for the period of 11:00 
p.m. Sunday through 7:30 a.m. Monday, the nurse will receive weekend premium for all hours 
worked during that period if the nurse has worked at least four (4) hours during that period. 
Premium pay provided for in this section shall not apply to time spent for educational purposes. 
 
16 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
8.14  Rest Between Shifts. In scheduling work assignments, the Employer will make a good 
faith effort to provide each nurse with at least ten (10) hours off-duty between shifts. In the event 
a nurse is required to work with less than ten (10) hours off duty between shifts, all time worked 
on the shift following the rest period of less than ten (10) hours will be paid at one and one-half 
(1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay, unless double time is required pursuant to Section 7.5. This 
Section shall not apply to non-mandatory continuing education, committee meetings, staff 
meetings, or to time spent on standby and callback assignments performed pursuant to Article 8. 
8.15  Work on a Scheduled Day Off. Full-time 8/80 nurses and full-time nurses working three 
(3) twelve (12) hour shifts per seven (7) day period called in on their regularly scheduled day off 
shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay for the hours 
worked; provided, however, this section shall not apply to non-mandatory committee meetings, 
staff meetings or educational offering occurring on the nurse’s scheduled day off. Nurses who 
are low censused on their regularly scheduled shift shall be considered to have worked the shift 
for the purposes of this section.

the next higher level on the first full payroll period following their anniversary date after 
completion of the required calendar years of service as set forth above. (For example, a nurse 
will move from the .0384/paid hour rate to the .0692/paid hour rate on the day after the nurse’s 3rd 
year anniversary, regardless of the nurse’s FTE status.) 
10.3  Vacation Scheduling. The Employer retains the right to schedule vacations so that there 
will be no disruption in the Hospital routine. The nurse with the most seniority with the 
Employer will have priority in selecting vacation time. To ensure that vacation requests during 
summer prime time will be considered, requests to take accrued vacation in the months of June 
through August must be submitted to the Nursing Office by February 1 of each year. In no event 
will requests submitted before February 1 for prime time (June through August) exceed one (1) 
week for 7 Day Staffing nurses and three (3) weeks for all other nurses. Requests to take 
vacation between November 15 and January 15 (winter prime time) must be submitted to the 
 
18 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
Nursing Office by August 1 of each year. Nurses requesting a full week off during prime time 
will receive priority over nurses requesting individual days off within a work week during prime 
time. Nurses wishing to apply for vacation during non-prime time must submit their request at 
least one month in advance. The Employer will respond within fourteen (14) days of the 
submission deadline for prime time or receipt of the non-prime time request. Nurses are not 
permitted to request vacation more than a year in advance. Vacation scheduling shall be subject 
to prior supervisory approval. 
10.4  Nurses may take paid vacation time off as they accrue vacation hours, subject to prior 
scheduling as described above. Vacation hours balances shall not exceed two hundred (200) 
hours. Vacation pay shall include shift differential. 
10.5  Direct Cash Payment Option. At the nurse’s request, accrued vacation hours may be paid 
off in cash rather than scheduling and taking paid vacation time off 
10.6  Payment on Termination. Nurses shall be paid upon termination of employment for all 
vacation earned; provided, however, this provision shall not apply to those nurses who terminate 
their employment without giving the required twenty-one (21) days’ prior written notice. 
ARTICLE 11 - SICK LEAVE 
11.1  Accrual.  Sick leave shall be accumulated by eligible nurses at rate of .046 per paid hour 
up to a maximum of 576 hours. Sick leave benefits shall be accrued from the date of hire. 
11.1.1 Accrual Under the Washington Paid Sick Leave Law (WPSL). All nurses not 
eligible to receive contractual sick leave under Article 11.1 shall accrue one (1) hour of WPSL 
for every forty (40) hours worked with no cap on the hours that such nurses are allowed to accrue 
each year. 
11.1.2 Coordination of Contractual Sick Leave and WPSL. For nurses eligible for both 
contractual sick leave and WPSL, the WPSL hours are included in the contractual sick leave 
accruals. However, the Hospital will track accrued contractual sick leave and WPSL hours 
separately. Contractual sick leave and WPSL hours will be used concurrently until either is exhausted 
when utilized in accordance with this Article. 
11.2  
Use of Contractual Sick Leave. Contractual sick leave benefits shall be paid at the nurse’s 
straight time rate of pay for bona fide cases of personal illness or injury, including pregnancy, 
miscarriage, abortion, and childbirth, which has incapacitated the nurse from performing regular 
duties. Contractual sick leave may be used for illness or injury of a dependent child under the age of 
eighteen (18) years. Accrued contractual sick leave may also be used in the event of a health 
condition of a nurse’s child under the age of 18 that requires treatment or supervision, or for a child 
age 18 or older and incapable of self care due to mental or physical disability, or in the event of a 
serious health condition or an emergency condition of a nurse’s spouse, parent, parent-in-law or 
grandparent in accordance with and subject to the Washington Family Care Act (RCW 49.12.265-
.295) as it may be amended from time to time. The Hospital reserves the right to require reasonable 
proof of such illness or injury. Excessive absenteeism will be subject to counseling/disciplinary 
action in accordance with Hospital attendance policies.

4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
11.2.1 Use of WPSL. A nurse using WPSL shall be paid at the regular rate of pay including 
all premiums, certifications, etc., the nurse would have been paid had the nurse worked during the 
period the nurse used WPSL. Employees may take WPSL for any purpose required under law, 
including: 
(i) to care for themselves or a family member for the following reasons: mental or physical 
illness, injury, or health condition; to accommodate the employee’s need for medical diagnosis, care, 
or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or an employee’s need for 
preventive medical care; and 
(ii) When the employee’s place of business has been closed by order of a public official for 
any health-related reason, or when an employee’s child’s school or place of care has been closed for 
such a reason; and 
(iii) For absences that qualify for leave under the domestic violence leave act, chapter 49.76 
RCW. 
For purposes of this section, “family member” means any of the following: 
(a) 
A child, including a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, or a child to whom 
the employee stands in loco parentis, is a legal guardian, or is a de facto parent, regardless of age or 
dependency status; 
(b) 
A biological, adoptive, de facto, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of an 
employee or the employee’s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco 
parentis when the employee was a minor child, or a parent-in-law; 
(c) 
A spouse; 
(d) 
A registered domestic partner; 
(e) 
A grandparent; 
(d) 
A grandchild; or 
(e) 
A sibling. 
11.3  
Notification of Absence for Contractual Sick Leave. Unless not possible due to 
circumstances beyond the nurse’s control, nurses shall notify the Employer at least two (2) hours in 
advance of the nurse’s scheduled shift if the nurse is unable to report for duty as scheduled. The 
nurse must notify the Employer each day of absence if the nurse is unable to work unless prior 
arrangements have been made with supervision. Failure to comply with the above specified 
notification requirements may result in loss of contractual sick leave for that day. 
11.3.1 Notification of Unforeseeable Absence for WPSL. Unless impractical, nurses shall 
notify the Employer at least two (2) hours in advance of the nurse’s scheduled shift if the 
nurse is unable to report for duty as scheduled. The nurse must notify the Employer each day 
of absence if the nurse is unable to work unless prior arrangements have been made with 
supervision. If the use of WPSL is for an authorized purpose under the Domestic Violence 
 
20 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
Leave Act and is unforeseeable, then the nurse shall notify the Employer no later than the end 
of the first day of absence. 
11.4  
Workers’ Compensation. In any case in which a nurse would be entitled to benefits or 
payments under the Industrial Insurance Act those payments shall be in lieu of the nurse’s regular 
sick pay benefits otherwise payable. It shall be the nurse’s option to use contractual sick leave 
benefits as compensation for the difference between Worker’s Compensation payments and the 
nurse’s regular rate of pay. 
11.5  
Proof of Illness. The Employer reserves the right to require reasonable written proof of 
illness. Proven abuse of contractual sick leave may be cause for discipline. 
11.5.1 Proof of Illness for WPSL. The Employer may not require verification for use of 
WPSL for absences of three (3) days or less. The Employer will not adopt or enforce any 
policy that counts the lawful use of WPSL as an absence that may lead to or result in 
discipline against the employee. 
11.6  
Sick Leave Conversion to Vacation. After one (1) full calendar year of continuous 
employment and annually thereafter, nurses who have demonstrated superior attendance may qualify 
for the conversion of unused sick leave hours to vacation hours. If less than 32 hours have been paid 
as sick leave during the first calendar year of employment, up to 32 hours of accrued sick leave may 
be converted to 16 hours of (1) cash payment or (2) vacation credit and added to the nurse’s vacation 
accrual for use like any other vacation time. 
After three years of continuous employment and annually thereafter, nurses who have been paid less 
than 32 hours of sick leave during the prior calendar year of employment may convert up to 32 hours 
of accrued sick leave to 32 hours of (1) cash payment or (2) vacation credit and added to the nurse’s 
vacation accrual for use like any other vacation time. 
This benefit shall be prorated for eligible part-time nurses. Sick hours paid in the prior calendar 
year will be subtracted from the eligible hours. For example, a nurse who has taken 8 hours of 
sick leave during the prior calendar year may elect to convert 24 hours of sick leave to 12 hours 
of vacation or cash payment (32-8 = 24 ± 2 = 12). This ratio is 1:1 after three (3) years of 
employment. 
11.6.1 Nurses who have accumulated the maximum 576 hours shall convert fifty percent 
(50%) of the unused sick leave in excess of 576 hours to cash. Effective the first pay 
period of January 2002, the cut-off date will be changed to the last pay period of the 
calendar year 2002. 
ARTICLE 12 - LEAVES OF ABSENCE 
12.1  In General. All leaves of absence must be requested from the Employer in writing as far 
in advance as possible, stating the reason for the leave and the amount of time requested. A 
written reply to grant or deny the request and stating the conditions of the leave of absence shall 
be given by the Employer within thirty (30) days of the request. All leaves of absence shall be 
without pay unless specifically provided for herein or agreed to by the Employer. Accrued 
vacation time must be used prior to requesting a leave of absence. A leave of absence begins on 
the first day of absence from work. 
 
21 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
12.2  Disability (Maternity and Health) Leave. After one (1) year of continuous employment, a 
leave of absence for maternity or other health reasons shall be granted upon the recommendation 
of a physician for the period of disability up to six (6) months , without loss of benefits to the 
date such leave commences. The leave shall be granted after sick leave which the nurse is 
eligible to receive has been utilized. Nurses on a disability leave will be allowed to return to the 
nurse’s former position so long as the total absence (including time on paid sick leave and/or 
vacation) does not exceed ninety (90) calendar days. An employee on a medical leave of absence 
for longer than ninety (90) calendar days will receive priority for the first available similar 
opening for which the employee is qualified. Except for references to sick leave, the leave of 
absence provisions of this section shall apply to adoption. 
12.3  Parenting Leave. After one (1) year of continuous regular employment, permission shall 
be granted for a leave of absence to: (a) care for a newborn or newly adopted child of the 
employee under the age of six at the time of placement or adoption, or (b) care for a child under 
the age of eighteen years old of the employee who has a terminal health condition. A leave of 
absence begins on the first absence from work or, in the case of childbirth, on the first day after 
the mother’s temporary medical disability from childbirth has ended. Parenting leave shall be 
unpaid except: (a) an employee shall use accrued vacation at the beginning of the leave, and (b) 
an employee on leave to care for a seriously ill child may use accrued sick leave at the beginning 
of the leave as permitted by state law and thereafter use accrued vacation. Except in special 
circumstances, employees must give at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice of parenting 
leave. Parenting leave must be completed within twelve (12) months after the birth or placement 
for adoption. An employee on parenting leave not exceeding twelve (12) weeks from date of first 
absence from work or, in the case of childbirth, from the day after the mother’s temporary 
medical disability from childbirth has ended, shall be entitled to return to his or her prior 
position. Thereafter, the employee shall be entitled to the first available position for which the 
employee is qualified. Such leave shall not exceed one (1) year. If both parents of the newborn or 
newly adopted child are employees, they shall be entitled to a total of twelve (12) weeks of 
parenting leave to be granted to only one employee parent at a time. Alleged violations of the 
parenting leave provisions shall be submitted to the grievance procedure set forth herein in 
accordance with the Family Leave Law. Parenting leave shall be consistent with and subject to 
the conditions and limitations set forth by state law. 
12.4  Family and Medical Leave. As required by federal law, upon completion of twelve (12) 
months of employment, which need not be continuous, any employee who has worked at least 
one thousand two hundred fifty (1250) hours during the prior twelve (12) months shall be 
entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave per year for the birth, adoption or placement 
of a foster child; to care for a spouse or immediate family member with a serious health 
condition; or when the employee is unable to work due to a serious health condition. The 
Employer shall maintain the employees’ health benefits during this leave and shall reinstate the 
employee to the employee’s former or equivalent position at the conclusion of the leave. 
If a particular period of leave qualifies under both the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 
(FMLA), state law or this Agreement, the leaves shall run concurrently, except for leaves related 
to disability due to pregnancy or child birth. This leave shall be interpreted consistently with the 
rights, requirements, limitations and conditions set forth in the federal law and shall not be more 
broadly construed. The employee must use any accrued paid leave time for which the employee 
 
22 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
is eligible during the leave of absence. The use of Family or Medical Leave shall not result in the 
loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the commencement of the leave. 
Under certain conditions, Family or Medical Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced 
work schedule. Generally, employees must give at least thirty (30) days, advance notice to the 
Employer of the request for leave when the leave is foreseeable. 
12.4.1  FMLA Leave to Care for an Active Duty Service Member. To the extent required by 
applicable law, an eligible nurse is entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave during any 
12-month period because of any qualifying exigency as defined by the Department of Labor 
arising out of the fact that the spouse, son, daughter or parent of the nurse is on active duty in the 
Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation. 
12.4.2  FMLA Leave to Care for an Injured Service Member. To the extent required by 
applicable law, an eligible nurse is entitled to twenty-six (26) weeks of unpaid leave during any 
12-month period to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin (nearest blood relative) 
with a serious injury or illness when the injury or illness is incurred by an active duty member of 
the military while in the line of duty. A covered service member is a member of the Armed 
Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical 
treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the 
temporary disability retired list for a serious injury or illness. 
12.5  Personal Leave. After one (1) calendar year of continuous employment, a nurse may 
apply for a personal leave of absence without pay. The Employer will determine whether or not 
the leave shall be granted and the duration thereof. Personal leaves of absence will not generally 
be granted for longer than three (3) months. 
12.6  Military Leave. In accordance with state law, a leave of absence required in order for a 
nurse to maintain status in a military reserve of the United States shall be granted with pay, 
without loss of benefits accrued to the date such leave commences, and shall not be considered 
part of the nurse’s earned annual leave time. 
12.6.1 Military Spouse Leave. To the extent required by applicable law, up to fifteen (15) 
days of unpaid leave will be granted to a qualified nurse (nurse who averages twenty (20) 
or more hours of work per week) whose spouse is on leave from deployment or before 
and up to deployment during a period of military conflict. A nurse who takes leave under 
this provision may elect to substitute any of the accrued paid leave to which the nurse is 
entitled for any part of the leave provided under this provision. The nurse must provide 
his/her Employer with notice of the nurse’s intention to take leave within five (5) 
business days of receiving official notice that the nurse’s spouse will be on leave or of an 
impending call to active duty. 
12.6.2 Active Duty/Active Training Duty Military Leave. To the extent required by 
applicable law a nurse shall be entitled to military leave with regular pay (regular pay on 
regular shifts missed) not to exceed twenty-one (21) working days during each year, 
beginning October 1st and ending the following September 30th, in order to report for 
active duty, when called, or to take part in active training duty in such manner and at such 
 
23 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
time as they may be ordered to active duty or active training duty in the Washington 
National Guard or of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Marine Corps reserve 
of the United States or of any organized reserve or armed forces of the United States. 
12.7  Continuing Education. All full-time nurses shall be allowed five hundred dollars ($500) 
per calendar year (prorated for part-time nurses) to use for work related educational opportunities 
and related expenses, i.e. reimbursement for tuition and salary. Up to five hundred dollars ($500) 
may be carried over from year to year with no more than five hundred dollars ($500) carried over 
from prior years. Attendance at programs developed by the Employer will be purchased with this 
allowance. Requests for continuing education time off on scheduled work days must be applied 
for at least twenty-one (21) days in advance on a form provided by the employee. The Employer 
shall be subject to scheduling requirements and certification of attendance and/or completion of 
the educational program. It shall not be the policy of the Hospital to require attendance at in-
service/educational programs provided by the employer. In the event an in-service/educational 
program were mandated by the Employer, the Joint Commission, or state law, and is a condition 
of employment, attendance at such program will be considered as time worked and paid for at 
the applicable rate of pay and not taken from the nurse’s educational fund, excluding 
requirements imposed by the state for maintaining licensure. When the Employer requires the 
nurse to participate in an educational program (which shall exclude programs for maintaining 
licensure and specialty certification), the Employer will pay approved expenses that are directly 
related to the program. 
12.7.1 Attendance on Day Off. If a nurse attends an approved educational offering on a 
scheduled day off, the nurse may access pay of up to 50% of the nurse’s regularly 
scheduled working hours from the nurse’s continuing education fund. 
12.7.2 Full-Time Nurses. For purposes of determining eligibility for continuing education 
funds (Section 12.6) and certification examination costs (Section 12.7), nurses working 
7/70s (70 hours/pay period), 7/40s (80 hours/pay period), 3/12s (72 hours/pay period) as 
well as 8/80 (80 hours/pay period) shall be considered full-time. 
12.8  Certification Exams. Subject to Employer approval of the certifying agency, and 
successful completion of the examination, the Employer will pay the costs of examination fees 
for specialty area certification exams, prorated for part-time nurses. If the employment 
relationship is terminated in less than six (6) months of the examination date, the nurse will 
return to the Employer the amount received for examination fees. 
12.9  Unpaid Education Leave. After one (1) calendar year of continuous employment, 
permission may be granted for a leave of absence without pay for job-related study, without loss 
of benefits, provided such leave does not jeopardize Hospital service. 
12.10  Bereavement Leave. Nurses shall be allowed up to twenty-four (24) hours off with pay 
(pro rata for part-time nurses) in case of a death in the nurse’s immediate family. If the nurse is 
required to travel in excess of five hundred (500) miles, up to sixteen (16) additional hours (pro 
rata for part-time nurses) may be granted. Immediate family shall be defined as spouse, domestic 
partner, child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, or the in-law 
equivalent of parent, brother or sister. 
 
24 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
12.11  Jury Duty. Any nurse who is called upon to serve on jury duty on a regularly scheduled 
working day shall be compensated by the Hospital for the difference between the amount of any 
compensation derived from jury duty (excluding mileage reimbursement) and the normal straight 
time rate of pay due the nurse for the period of jury service. All nurses who receive a jury 
summons should report immediately to their supervisor to discuss time off for jury service. 
When reporting for jury service, the nurse shall request of the jury bailiff that the nurse be 
released as soon as the nurse’s services are no longer needed. If a nurse is excused by the court 
on any day of such duty falling within the normal work week schedule, the nurse shall then 
notify the supervisor and, if asked, directly report to work for the balance of the normal shift. 
12.12  Sabbatical Leave. The purpose of a sabbatical leave is to provide an extended period of 
unpaid leave from a registered nurse’s customary work to acquire new skills or training. The 
sabbatical makes available the necessary time to pursue significant professional development 
activities, e.g., full-time academic study, participation in research projects, foreign travel to 
examine alternative health care options, providing health care in underserved areas and 
publishing. Nurses are eligible for their first sabbatical after working a minimum of ten (10) 
calendar years of regular and continuous full-time employment as a registered nurse with the 
Employer. An employee who qualifies may request (1) sabbatical of up to six (6) months or (2) a 
sabbatical of up to one (1) year after working fifteen (15) years on a continuous full-time basis. 
Applications must be forwarded to the Chief Nurse Executive at least ninety (90) days prior to 
the proposed starting date of the sabbatical leave. Nurses granted a sabbatical will be able to self-
pay medical, dental and life insurance benefits subject to the availability of insurance coverage, 
and will retain their seniority. The total number of sabbatical leaves that may be granted during 
any one calendar year will not exceed three (3). An employee granted a sabbatical agrees to 
return to regular employment with the Hospital following sabbatical for at least one (1) year. 
Employees returning from sabbatical leave of no more than six (6) months shall be reinstated to 
their prior position, provided they have pursued the professional activities as outlined above. 
Thereafter, employees will be reinstated to the first available position for which they are 
qualified. Within forty-five (45) days of returning from a sabbatical leave, the nurse will provide 
a report(s) regarding the knowledge gained while on leave to the Chief Nurse Executive and/or 
the nursing staff in a format mutually agreed upon. An employee is eligible to apply for another 
sabbatical only after seven (7) years have elapsed after the original sabbatical leave. The final 
decision to grant or deny a sabbatical will be made by the Chief Nurse Executive. 
12.13  Benefits During Leave. A nurse on an unpaid leave of absence will not continue to accrue 
benefits during that leave, but there shall be no loss of previously accrued benefits if the nurse 
returns to work as scheduled at the end of the allowed leave. To the extent allowed by the 
applicable insurance policy, a nurse desiring insurance benefits to continue during a leave of 
absence may do so by paying the full premium to the Employer monthly in advance unless 
otherwise provided by law for a family or medical leave. 
12.14  Return to Work. Nurses who indicate their availability to return to work on a timely basis 
in accordance with an approved leave of absence agreement shall be entitled to the same position 
if the leave is ninety (90) days or less, including both paid and unpaid time. If the leave exceeds 
ninety (90) days, the nurse shall be given the first available similar opening for which the nurse 
is qualified. A nurse who does not return to work at the end of the allowed leave of absence may 
 
25 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
be terminated as of the last paid day. Reapplication shall be necessary for any further 
employment.

ARTICLE 16 - GRIEVANCE. PROCEDURE 
16.1  Definition. A grievance is defined as an alleged breach of the express terms and 
conditions of the Agreement. It is the desire of the parties to this Agreement that grievances be 
adjusted informally wherever possible and at the first level of supervision. If a grievance arises, 
it shall be submitted to the following grievance procedure. 
Time limits set forth in the following steps may only be extended by mutual written consent of 
the parties hereto. If the management representative at any level is not a Registered Nurse and 
the grievance arises from nursing practice issues, at the request of either party an additional 
management representative at the equivalent level who is a Registered Nurse shall be present at 
the grievance meeting. 
Step 1. Nurse and Manager .  
If any nurse has a grievance, the nurse and/or the Local Unit Chairperson, or designee, shall first 
present the grievance in writing to the nurse’s Manager within fourteen (14) calendar days from 
the date the nurse became aware or reasonably should have been aware of the event from which 
the grievance arose. Upon receipt thereof, the parties shall meet at a mutually agreeable time for 
the purpose of resolving the grievance. The Manager or designee shall attempt to resolve the 
problem and shall respond in writing to the nurse and Local Unit Chairperson, or designee, 
within fourteen (14) calendar days following the grievance meeting. 
Step 2. Nurse, Local Unit Chairperson and Director.  
If the matter is not resolved to the nurse’s satisfaction at Step 1, the nurse and/or the Local Unit 
Chairperson, or designee, shall present the grievance in writing to the Director (and/or 
designated representative) within fourteen (14) calendar days of the Local Unit Chairperson’s, or 
designee’s receipt of Manager’s or designee’s decision. A conference between the nurse, the 
Local Unit Chairperson, or designee, and the Director or designee shall be held at a mutually 
agreeable time. The Director or designee shall issue a written reply to the nurse, the Local Unit 
Chairperson or designee, and the Association within fourteen (14) calendar days following the 
grievance meeting. 
Step 3. Nurse, Chief Nursing Officer and Association Representative.  
If the matter is not resolved to the nurse’s satisfaction at Step 2, the nurse and/or Local Unit 
Chairperson, or designee, shall present the grievance in writing to the Chief Nursing Officer 
(and/or designated representative) within fourteen (14) calendar days of the Local Unit 
Chairperson’s, or designee’s receipt of the written response from Step 2. A conference between 
the nurse, Local Unit Chairperson or designee, and the Chief Nursing Officer or a designee shall 
 
29 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
then be held within fourteen (14) calendar days for the purpose of resolving the grievance. The 
Chief Nursing Officer or a designee shall endeavor to resolve the grievance and will respond in 
writing to the nurse, the Local Unit Chairperson or designee, and the Association within fourteen 
(14) calendar days of the meeting with the nurse and Local Unit Chairperson, or designee. 
Step 4. Arbitration 
If the grievance is not settled on the basis of the foregoing procedures, the Association may 
submit the issue in writing to final and binding arbitration within fourteen (14) calendar days of 
its receipt of the decision of the Administrator or designee in Step 3. If the Hospital and the 
Association fail to agree on the arbitrator, a list of eleven (11) arbitrators shall be requested from 
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties shall thereupon alternate in striking 
a name from the panel until one name remains. The person whose name remains shall be the 
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or otherwise change or 
modify the provisions of this Agreement, but shall be authorized only to interpret existing 
provisions of this Agreement as they may apply to the specific facts of the issue in dispute. Each 
party shall bear one-half (1/2) of the fee of the Arbitrator and any other expense jointly incurred 
by mutual consent incident to the arbitration hearing. All other expenses shall be borne by the 
party incurring them, and neither party shall be responsible for the expenses of witnesses called 
by the other party. If necessary, the Arbitrator shall resolve discovery rights of the parties as to 
grievances submitted to arbitration. 
16.2  Group Grievance. Any common grievance involving two (2) or more nurses which has 
the same factual basis may with the consent of the Employer be submitted by the Association at 
the Step 2 level, provided that the grievance is submitted within fourteen (14) calendar days from 
the date the nurse(s) became aware or reasonably should have been aware of the event from 
which the grievance arose. 
ARTICLE 17 - GENERAL PROVISIONS  
17.1  The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement all 
had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any 
subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the 
understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and 
opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, the Employer and the Association, for the 
term of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that 
the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter 
specifically discussed during negotiations and/or covered in this Agreement. The parties further 
agree, however, that this Agreement may be amended by the mutual consent of the parties in 
writing at any time during its term.

are mutually canceled and superseded by this Agreement. Unless specifically provided herein to 
the contrary, past practices shall not be binding on the Employer.

to, a fire, flood, explosion, power failure, earthquake, or other act outside the control of the 
Employer and causing disruption to the Hospital’s normal operations. 
17.4  Savings Clause. This Agreement shall be subject to all future and present applicable 
federal and state laws, executive orders of the President of the United States or the Governor of 
the State of Washington, and rules and regulations of governing authority. Should any provision 
or provisions become unlawful by virtue of the declaration of any court of competent

This Addendum between EvergreenHealth (EH, Employer or Hospital) and the Washington State 
Nurses Association (WSNA or Association) shall apply to registered nurses employed in the Evergreen 
Home Care Services (EHCS) Unit of EH. EHCS consists of Hospice Home Care, Home Health, 
Behavioral Health and Palliative Care nursing services. Except as modified herein, the terms and 
conditions set forth in the Employment Agreement shall apply to Home Care nurses working under 
this Addendum. 
1. 
Bulletin Board Posting (2.5). 
Postings shall be in accordance with section 2.5. The Association shall be permitted to post Association 
notices/newsletters on bulletin board space designated by the Employer at the Branch Offices. 
2. 
Definitions (Article 4). 
Salaried After Hours Nurse. A nurse who is hired by the Employer to be available for coverage of 
Hospice Home Care during the hours 1900 to 0800, whose pay each pay period is predetermined and 
not subject to reduction because of the variation in the quality or quantity of work performed. A 
Salaried After Hours Nurse shall not receive overtime, differentials or premiums set forth in the 
Agreement, except for a lump sum payment of three hundred twelve dollars and seventy-five cents 
($312.75) per pay period. This definition shall be interpreted consistently with the Fair Labor Standards 
Act. 
3. 
Mileage.  
Nurses shall be reimbursed for business related driving at the current IRS rate per mile. If the allowance 
published by the IRS for business mileage tax deduction purposes increases during the term of this 
Agreement, the mileage reimbursement rate shall be increased by the same amount, effective the first 
month following the publication date of the IRS allowance increase. 
4. 
Driver’s License/Liability Insurance. 
Each nurse, as a condition of employment, shall at all times keep current evidence that the nurse holds 
a valid Washington State driver’s license and has the minimum automobile liability insurance coverage 
as required by the State of Washington. 
5 
Job Postings (Article 5). 
All of the provisions of Article 5.3 of the Agreement shall apply except for the requirement that job 
openings shall be posted on bulletin boards in the units. Instead, notification of Home Care job 
openings shall be posted in the Hospital, posted on the Employer’s web site, and emailed to Home 
Care employees at least three (3) calendar days in advance of filling the position. 
 
34 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
6. 
Work Day and Meal Period (7.7). 
Nurses shall have an unpaid meal period of up to one (1) hour for each scheduled shift of eight (8) or 
more hours in duration. 
7. 
Overtime (7.5 et. seq.). Overtime shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the 
nurse’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked by the nurse beyond forty (40) hours per week. After 
Hours Salaried Nurses shall not receive overtime pay. 
If a full-time or part-time Home Care nurse works beyond the work day (as defined in Article 7.1) and 
does not receive overtime pay as described above, the nurse may submit a written request to his/her 
manager or designee for a reduction in daily work assignment equal to the number of hours worked 
beyond the work day within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the request, provided the 
nurse works all scheduled hours during the fourteen (14) day period. The request must be submitted 
electronically by 2:00 p.m. on the calendar day following the worked day. This section shall not apply 
to time spent in non-mandatory committee meetings, staff meetings, or time spent for educational 
purposes (i.e., CE days, educational leave, educational offerings, etc.). 
A reasonable effort will be made to schedule the nurse for a reduced work assignment on a mutually-
agreeable date. If a date cannot be mutually agreed upon, the manager or designee reserves the right to 
select the scheduled shift(s) that will have a reduced daily work assignment. If the manager or designee 
is unable to reduce the nurse’s daily work assignment within fourteen (14) days, the employee shall be 
paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the nurse’s regular rate of pay for all hours worked 
beyond the normal work day on the day that exceeded the work day, provided the nurse works all 
scheduled hours during the fourteen (14) day period. The manager or designee will submit an entry 
into the time and attendance system to authorize the difference between the regular and overtime pay. 
If the nurse does not send the written request by 2:00 p.m. on the day following the worked day, the 
nurse forfeits the ability to have a reduction in scheduled hours or to receive overtime pay for the day 
that was worked beyond the work day. In such a case, the nurse shall receive pay at his/her regular rate 
for the hours worked. 
If the nurse declines a reduced daily work assignment and/or volunteers to pick up extra hours or visits 
on a day that was scheduled for reduced daily work assignment, the nurse forfeits the ability to have 
another reduction in scheduled hours or to receive overtime pay for the day that was worked beyond 
the work day. In such a case, the nurse shall receive pay at his/her regular rate for the hours worked. 
In all cases, a nurse shall receive overtime pay for all hours worked by the nurse beyond forty (40) 
hours per workweek.  Evergreen will provide training on the use of the Reduced Work Assignment 
(“RWA”) in EHCS orientation; the form will be available on a designated place on the file server, and 
an email reminder will be sent to current nurses reminding them of the process within 14 days of 
ratification. 
8. 
Shift Differential (8.4). 
The evening shift shall start at 5 p.m. Except as modified herein, the terms and conditions set forth in 
Section 8.4 shall apply to Home Care nurses working under this Addendum. 
9.

35 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
Callback pay shall be paid when called out for a home visit while on standby or backup standby status. 
Telephone calls and related documentation will be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) with a 
fifteen (15) minute minimum for each call. Separate phone calls relating to the same patient made in 
conjunction with the original phone call will be considered as one phone consultation for purposes of 
the minimum guarantee. All other provisions of Section 8.6 shall apply. 
10. 
Work in Advance of Shift (8.11). 
This provision shall not apply to Home Care nurses. 
11. 
Rest Between Shifts (8.14). 
This provision shall not apply to Home Care nurses due to flexible scheduling unless preapproved by 
management. 
12. 
Work on a Scheduled Day Off (Section 8.15).  
This provision shall not apply to Home Care nurses. 
13. 
PTO Plan, Holiday and EIB Plan (Articles 9, 10 and 11). 
Home Care nurses may maintain their participation in EH’s Paid Time Off (PTO), Holiday and 
Extended Illness Bank (EIB) plan (see prior Memorandum of Understanding entitled PTO, Holiday 
and EIB Plan). Articles 9 (Holidays), 10 (Vacations) and 11 (Sick Leave) of the collective bargaining 
agreement to which this Addendum is appended shall apply to all newly hired, transferred or promoted 
Home Care nurses regularly working 16 or more hours per week except for those nurses who have not 
elected to convert their PTO and EIB. 
14. 
Benefit Option Plan (13.2). 
In addition to the application of section 13.2 to part-time nurses, full-time Home Care nurses 
maintaining participation in EH’s PTO, Holiday and EIB plans shall continue to be eligible for the 
Benefit Option Plan. 
15. 
Grievance Procedure (Section 16.1). 
Step 3 of the grievance procedure shall include the nurse, Local Unit Chairperson or designee, and 
Chief Nursing Officer or designee. 
16. 
Per Diem Nurses (Addendum 3)  All per diem positions must be posted as offering the 
applicant the choice of a Tier 1 or a Tier 2 position.  Per diem nurses shall have the option once 
per calendar year to change from one Tier to the other.  Tier 1 per diem nurses are required to be 
available to work at least forty (40) hours per calendar month, including two (2) weekend shifts 
within those forty (40) hours.  Tier 2 per diem nurses are required to be available to work at least

the wage schedule set forth in Article 8 of the Agreement, plus a seventeen percent (17%) 
premium, and Tier 2 per diem nurses shall be paid in accordance with the wage schedule set 
forth in Article 8 of this Agreement, plus a twenty percent (20%) premium.

EVERGREENHEALTH 
PER DIEM NURSES   
ADDENDUM 3  
The following conditions of employment shall apply to per diem nurses: 
1. 
Definition. A per diem nurse is a nurse regularly scheduled to work less than sixteen 
(16) hours per week or hired to work during any period when additional work of any nature 
requires a temporarily augmented work force, or in the event of an emergency or nurse 
absenteeism, . Per diem nurses are required to be available to work at least twenty-four (24) 
hours per calendar month, with the understanding that per diem nurses shall not be required to 
make themselves available to work more than twenty-four (24) hours per month. 
Per diem nurses shall include nurses scheduled on a “call in” basis. Such nurses shall be paid in 
accordance with the wage schedule set forth in Article 8 of this Agreement, plus a seventeen 
percent (17%) premium. Per diem nurses shall accrue longevity steps but shall not receive any 
benefit compensation, except shift differential and holiday pay as set forth in the Agreement. 
Hours worked as a per diem nurse shall be recognized for placement in the compensation 
schedule for regular nurses if a nurse accepts regular status. Nurses converting from per diem 
status to regular status will be subject to a probationary period as provided for in Section 4.7 of 
the Employment Agreement. 
2. 
Canceled Shifts. If a per diem nurse has been prescheduled to work (in accordance with 
Medical Center policy) and is canceled within two (2) hours of the shift report time, the canceled 
shift will be counted as time worked for purposes of accruing longevity steps. To be credited for 
the canceled shift, the per diem nurse must record the canceled shift on the individual’s time card 
prior to the completion of that pay period. 
3. 
Regular Job Openings. Qualified per diem nurses presently employed at the Medical 
Center shall receive strong consideration for open positions, but the Medical Center retains the 
right to fill the position with whomever it feels is best qualified. 
If a per diem nurse is regularly scheduled to work the same set schedule and shifts of more than 
16 hours over a six month period that could constitute a .5 FTE or greater, upon the request of 
any bargaining unit nurse, the Employer will review the nurse’s hours to determine whether the 
hours of the per diem nurse should be posted as an FTE’d position. Any disputes may be 
presented to the Conference Committee for further review. 
4. 
Evaluations. The Employer shall maintain a system for performance appraisal providing 
for a written evaluation prior to or upon the completion of one hundred eighty (180) calendar 
days of employment and annually thereafter. 
5. 
Floating. The Employer retains the right to change the daily work assignment of per diem 
nurses to meet patient care needs. Per diem nurses required by the Employer to float to other units 
within the Medical Center shall not be required to perform tasks or procedures for which they have 
not been trained. 
 
38 
4860-5762-7413v.1 0046995-000123 
6. 
Scheduling and Canceling. The Medical Center will attempt to give as much notice as is 
reasonably possible to per diem nurses with respect to scheduling, changes in schedules, and 
canceling per diem nurses. Per diem nurses who report for work as scheduled shall be guaranteed a 
minimum of two (2) hours’ work unless the Employer has made a good faith effort to notify the per 
diem nurse in advance. Per diem nurses shall be responsible for maintaining current addresses and 
telephone numbers with the Employer. 
7. 
Continuing Education. If an education program (excluding programs for maintaining 
licensure and specialty certification) is a condition precedent to employment at EvergreenHealth or is 
mandated by the Joint Commission or state law, with prior approval of the immediate supervisor and 
after successful completion of the education program, the Employer will pay for tuition and related 
course materials. Attendance at the event shall be on unpaid time. 
8. 
Work on Holidays. Per diem nurses will be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times 
the regular rate of pay for each hour worked on the following holidays: New Year’s Day, President’s 
Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. 
9. 
Discipline and Discharge. The just cause and progressive discipline commitments set forth 
in Section 5.5 of the collective bargaining agreement shall not apply to per diem employees. 
10. 
In-service Education. An in-service program shall be maintained by the Medical Center. 
Attendance at required in service education programs shall be paid at the straight time rate of pay. 
11.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
HEALTH BENEFITS COMMITTEE 
2021-2024 
Both the Employer and the Association recognize the importance of ensuring that nurses have 
access to cost effective, quality health care and other insurance coverage. Both the Employer and 
the Association share a mutual interest in researching best practices in cost containment features 
and benefits that ensure quality but also address increasing costs. 
To address these issues, the Employer will establish a Health Benefits Committee. The 
Association will appoint up to five (5) representatives from the bargaining unit including one (1) 
Nurse Representative. The Employer will appoint up to five (5) management representatives. 
The Committee shall be advisory and shall meet monthly and more often as mutually agreed. All 
employee representatives on the committee will be on paid release time for the meetings. The 
Employer and Association agree to engage in a fully transparent process of information sharing 
that will lead to stronger engagement and overall success. 
This committee will concentrate efforts to research, review and recommend adoption of 
incentive-based wellness programs and other benefits changes to the Chief Nursing Officer. The 
goal of the committee’s work is to ensure that the medical benefit is affordable for employees 
and the cost increases are minimized.
